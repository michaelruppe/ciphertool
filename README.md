### To run the program
Compile: `gcc main.c`
Run: `./a.out`

Compile and run in one command: `gcc main.c && ./a.out`


### Files
 - **main.c**: The program.
 - **google-10000-english.txt**: The 10,000 most common English words in order of frequency, as determined by n-gram frequency analysis of the Google's Trillion Word Corpus.


### Why?
This program was made for a bit of fun. It's in no way robust and has loads of limitations eg. can only use CAPITAL letters.
Use and abuse as you see fit.
